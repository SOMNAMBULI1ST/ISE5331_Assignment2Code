# ISE5331_Assignment2Code

This repository contains the Python code used in the report  
**“Aviation Industry Monthly Data Regression Report”**  
submitted for the course **ISE5331**.

## 📌 Overview

This project performs a **multiple linear regression analysis** based on  
monthly aviation statistics from **January 2021 to December 2023**, including:

- Passenger throughput (10k persons)
- Flight movements (10k flights)
- Aircraft daily utilization (hours/day)
- Cargo & mail throughput (10k tons)

The goal is to quantify how these operational factors influence passenger throughput and to visualize the relationships using Python.
